Sustainable Web Design
==============================
This is a website aimed to inform readers about **sustainable web design**. 

**Sustainable web design** is a practice where web content designers follow specific design guidelines to reduce the web's energy consumption.
The website's content is taken from a report I wrote for a class project about sustainable web design. 

Following the guidelines of sustainable web design, the full report, titled *Your Digital Footprint: The Hidden Energy Consumption of the Websites*, is presented via a simple HTML and CSS website. Images, colors, and typography are kept to a minimum to decrease the website's page weight and overall energy consumption.
