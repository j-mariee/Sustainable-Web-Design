    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <article>
      <p>
       If the internet were its own country, it would be the sixth most polluting one in the world (Greenwood, 2021). 
        Sustainable web design is a practice that seeks to focus on reducing the web's carbon emissions and energy consumption. 
        As the ones who create content for the web, web designers must take responsibility and learn sustainable web design measures to 
        decrease the web's electricity consumption. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Inefficient data centers and excessive web content are the main issues with sustainable web design. Data centers used 
        about 1% of global electricity in 2010, however, the number is estimated to grow to 3%-13% by 2030 (Greenwood, 2021). 
        Green hosting, a practice where companies choose data providers powered by renewable energy, can be utilized to combat 
        the growing energy consumption of data centers. However, multiple types of green hosting complicate the effectiveness of 
        green hosting. Hyperscaling of data centers is a trend to combat inefficient data centers. Excessive web design is also 
        another issue with sustainable web design. Images, fonts, and colors all increase the page weight of webpages. 
        From 2003 to 2019 the average page weight of an image grew from 100KB to 4MB (Mcgovern, 2020). Designers should take care 
        to verify the value of content before adding it to a webpage. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The main barriers to sustainable web design are web designers being unaware of their responsibility to sustainability, 
        web designers being at the mercy of their customers when deciding what content gets added to webpages, web designers and 
        having little power over data center details. Solutions involve senior web designers spreading awareness of sustainable web design, 
        connecting sustainable design principles to customer goals, and junior web designers educating coworkers laying the groundwork 
        for company-wide education in the future.

      <h2>Introduction and Background</h2>
      <p>
        Our world is becoming increasingly integrated with the digital world. The internet has transitioned from something seen as a 
        leisure pastime for a few to an indispensable aspect of the global population's daily life. From school to work and our personal lives, 
        today, it is impossible to go a day, much less an hour, without using the internet in some shape or form. When seen in the context 
        of environmental impact, most of the public sees the transition from the physical to the digital realm as a good thing. 
        Digital documents over paper ones help to save trees and digital communication reduces gas usage by connecting online instead of 
        physically traveling. Not to mention the web applications in smart electrical grids and smart homes. However, in the midst of all 
        of these benefits lies a hidden drawback: the web's energy consumption. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Although almost invisible to the eye, the pixels that make up the interface of the web leave behind a large trail of emissions. 
        The internet's carbon footprint currently stands at 830 mtCO2/year (Christie, 2013). To help put that number into context, 
        if the internet were a country, it would be the sixth most polluting one in the world, comparable in emissions to that of 
        Germany (Greenwood, 2021). Many users of the web may be shocked to learn of the web's carbon footprint. How does something digital 
        have such a large physical impact? The answer lies in page weight.
      </p>

              <img width="800" height="500" src="https://github.umn.edu/Gonz0466/Formatting-Project/blob/main/Greenwood%20Graph.png?raw=true" 
             alt="Graph showing various countries' carbon emissions">
          </div>
      
      <p>
        Page weight is defined as the data transfer size of a webpage and is typically measured in kilowatt-hours per gigabyte (kWh/GB) 
        (Greenwood, 2021). The internet is too large for it all to be stored directly on each user's device. Instead, whenever a user does 
        an action online, the webpage retrieves all the necessary data (images, words, videos, etc) from an online server located hundreds 
        of miles away. This entire process of transferring the data requires energy. Additionally, energy is also consumed at the location 
        of the servers to keep them powered. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Bringing awareness to the energy consumption of the web is crucial due to the exponential growth of web users and time spent online. 
        More and more users are tuning into the internet every day. The number of devices per user has grown from 2.3 devices per user in 2016 
        to 3.5 in 2021 (Morley, et.al, 2017). More users online has naturally led to an increase in the amount of data transferred over the internet. 
        In 2002, traffic flow online was 100 GB per second. In 2016 the traffic flow grew to 26,600 GB per second. And it is estimated that this number 
        will more than triple in the next 5 years (Morley, et.al, 2017). This exponential increase will lead to a growth in demand from the energy 
        sector with predictions that communication technology will use 14 percent of global electricity by 2040 (Belkhir & Elmelgi, 2017). 
        In short, the rapid growth of the internet and its energy consumption rate could prove to be a dangerous source of carbon emissions 
        if action isn’t taken soon.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Society is heading towards a digital future and the energy consumption of the web demands attention. While the responsibility for the 
        energy consumption of the internet can be divided among various parties, web content designers hold a significant influence on 
        environmental impact. No matter the scale of their operations, whether they create content for a large corporation or on a small 
        personal website, it is the responsibility of each web content designer to educate themselves about the current concerns surrounding 
        the internet's electrical consumption and explore strategies to mitigate their environmental impact.
      </p>
     
      <h2>Discussion of the Issue</h2>
      
      <p>
        To combat the growing energy consumption of webpages and reduce carbon emissions, a group of web designers have started a movement called 
        sustainable web design. Sustainable web design is defined as “an approach to designing web services that prioritizes the health of our 
        home planet. At its core is a focus on reducing carbon emissions and energy consumption” (Greenwood, 2021). The movement's manifesto revolves 
        around five key principles: clean, efficient, open, honest, regenerative, and resilient. Drawing from the manifesto's principles, 
        two main issues currently surround sustainable web design: inefficient data centers, and excessive content on web pages.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Inefficient Data Centers</h3>
      <p>
        Currently, there is no way to use the internet without consuming electricity. Electricity is used to power the data centers where servers reside, 
        the cooling equipment for the servers such as air conditioners and chillers, and the battery backups (Belkhir & Elmelgi, 2017). 
        Additionally, the internet does not have a closing time. It is available any time of the day, which means that data centers run 24/7. 
        According to the director of the hosting company WP Engines, an average data center uses as much electricity as Maidenhead, a town located in 
        England with a population of over sixty thousand people (Greenwood, 2021). And it does not seem like data centers' electric consumption rate will 
        slow down anytime soon. In 2010, data centers used 1% of global electricity, however, they are now on track to use anywhere from 3%-13% in 
        2030 (Greenwood, 2021). With such large consumption rates, data centers can pose a danger to global carbon reduction goals such as the Paris Agreement.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Drawing from the 'clean' principle of sustainable web design, green hosting is another solution to the energy consumption of data centers. 
        Green hosting is a practice where companies choose a data provider that uses renewable energy to power their websites (Moneva, 2021). While this 
        solution seems relatively simple, different green hosting contracts complicate the matter (Greenwood, 2021). The following types of contracts are 
        typical ones used by green hosting companies:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          Owning renewables: The green host directly produces their renewable energy onsite. 
        </li>
        
        <li>
          Funding new renewables: In exchange for energy access, the green host will fund the 
          construction of renewable energy sources built by other electricity companies.
        </li>
        
        <li>
          Buying renewable energy: Renewable energy is bought from the electricity grid. 
          However, the energy the host receives may not directly be from renewable energy since 
          electrical grids pull from various sources.
        </li>
        
        <li>
          Renewable energy credits (RECs): Renewable energy is purchased from grids in other countries. 
          The power from these grids does not power the green host directly. Instead, 
          buying renewable energy helps to make renewable energy profitable in the country the grid is located in.
        </li>
        
        <li>
          Carbon offsetting: Green hosts pay other companies to reduce their own emissions so the green host does not have to. A sort of balance game.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        While green hosting is an effective method to combat the increasing energy consumption of data centers, its effectiveness relies on the direct 
        usage of renewable energy by green hosts. However, current data reveals a stark difference between our hope and reality. Data Center Alley,
         located in Virginia, is one of the largest collections of data centers in the world with more than 70% of the global internet traffic passing 
        through the area. However, only 5% of Data Center Alley's electricity is generated from renewable sources (Greenwood, 2021). Many large 
        corporations have also been found to lie about their renewable usage. In 2017, Google claimed to have achieved 100% percent renewable 
        energy usage. However, only 40% of their energy usage is from renewable sources tied to the same grid. RECs are used to supplement the rest. 
        (Greenwood, 2021). Failing to prioritize renewable energy and lying about its use goes against the fundamental principles of sustainable 
        web design.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Another method to curb electricity usage is transitioning from regular data centers to hyperscale data centers. Hyperscale data centers 
        vary from standard data centers in that they are built more efficiently. One server in a hyperscale data center can supplant 3.75 servers 
        in a typical data center (Greenwood, 2021). Large companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon are the main parties making this shift. 
        However, the increasing global internet demand is pushing many hyperscale data centers to their maximum power usage effectiveness. 
        As a result, our attention must now focus on strategies to limit energy consumption of the web. One way this can be done is by minimizing 
        web content.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Minimalizing Web Content</h3>
      <p>
        The increase in the web's energy consumption can be credited in part to the growing number of users. After all, it is common practice 
        that the more users use an application the more energy is required. However, the growing energy consumption of the web can also be attributed 
        to web designers. As websites have advanced over the years their capabilities have grown. Web designers have taken full advantage of this 
        advancement by creating web pages that display a variety of fonts, images, and videos. While these elements have made websites more 
        aesthetically pleasing, they have also increased the page weight of websites. The average page weight grew from 100 KB to 4 MB from 2003 
        to 2019 (Mcgovern, 2020). As mentioned earlier, page weight deals with the data transfer of a webpage. The more features a webpage has, 
        the larger its page weight, and a larger page weight leads to more energy consumed.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Photos are one of the most popular website elements that increase page weight. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, however, 
        in reality, it's more like 11,538. According to Greenwood, the average number of images found on a website is 13. In total, all of the 
        images equate to about 150,000 words, which is about the length of a 530-page book. Page weight-wise, the images equate to about 1 MB 
        (Greenwood, 2021). The page weight of images can fluctuate depending on their resolution and file format. By changing a 4K image to a 
        resolution of 8K the file size jumps from 6.9 MB to 18 MB (Mcgovern, 2020). Although they add to the aesthetic of a website, images are 
        not always necessary. Web designers should ensure the value of an image outweighs its carbon footprint before deciding to add it to the 
        website. If an image is required, changing the file type can help reduce page weight. WEBP is the best format for photographs, 
        reducing files 30% smaller than their JPG counterparts. AVIF, a new format gaining popularity, can be less than half the size of WEBP 
        (Greenwood, 2021).
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Although not as popular as photos, videos far outweigh the carbon emissions of photos. YouTube, a website revolving around video streaming, 
        produces 10 kg of CO2 every second (Greenwood, 2021). In terms of word count, one second of a video is equal to 50,000 words which is 
        equivalent to 300 KB (Mcgovern, 2020). Just like images, web designers should always take a step back and ensure that videos are a 
        necessary component and not add them just because they can. If videos are necessary, just like photos, they should also be optimized for 
        format and size. A video as a WEBM file weighs 80 MB, however, converting the video to an MP4 file decreases the video to 4% of its original 
        size coming in at a weight of 3 MB. Another small step to reduce page weight is to turn off autoplay. Without autoplay, videos start playing 
        automatically using data when a user may not even be watching the video.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Another web design element that affects page weight is color. Black and darker colors are more energy efficient than white and brighter colors. 
        The reasoning behind the decreased energy use is that darker colors do not require as much energy to activate the pixels of a screen. 
        In fact, a pixel-colored black is not active. Heap Media created a custom Google search engine called Black (Greenwood, 2021). The search 
        engine uses a black background and few secondary colors, as of writing this essay, the onsite energy counter reports that Black has saved 
        10,542,633.732 watts of electricity simply by using the darker background. Colors and images can also be combined to save energy if images 
        are converted to monochrome. An example of this is the UMN Twin Cities individual library pages designed by Amy Drayer. Although exact numbers 
        are not provided, Dryer states that the monochrome images significantly reduced file sizes increasing overall web performance (Greenwood, 2021).
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Another common element that affects page weight is typography. The most energy-efficient typography is pre-installed system fonts, since they 
        are installed directly on the device, no additional data transfer is required to load them. Common pre-installed fonts include Arial, 
        Times New Roman, Helvetica for Apple devices, and Roboto for Android devices. Adding additional fonts can add anywhere between 11 KB to 28 KB 
        to a website's page weight (Greenwood, 2021). Restricting a website to only pre-installed system fonts does limit the creative freedom of 
        web designers. If only using pre-installed system fonts is too constricting, Sustainable web designers suggest implementing pre-installed fonts 
        in places where users do not take account of fonts. For example, using pre-installed fonts in the body copy text, instead of in headings 
        and titles.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Minimalizing and optimizing content for the web not only decreases the energy consumption of websites but also makes them more user-friendly. 
        As more elements are added to a website, the more time it takes to load. A study found that in 2013 the average load time for a webpage was 
        4.3 seconds. In 2019 the load time had increased to 10.3 seconds (Mcgovern, 2020). A couple of seconds may not seem that critical, however, 
        studies have also shown that the longer a webpage takes to load the fewer users stick around. A study conducted by Google revealed that 
        53% of users left a webpage if it took longer than 3 seconds to load. The aesthetic of a webpage is not the only factor that web designers 
        should consider when creating a website. Using sustainable web design principles can help minimize web content and minimize webpages 
        electricity use.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Future Actions and Solutions</h2>
      <p>
        Multiple barriers need to be overcome in order to make sustainable web design practices commonplace among web designers by 2030. 
        The first barrier is changing the mindset among web designers that sustainability is not one of their core responsibilities. 
        As mentioned before, it is easy for all web users to brush past the energy consumption of the internet. Unlike a car that shoots out gas plumes, 
        we can not see the web's carbon emissions. This lack of instant visibility also helps paint a positive image of the societal shift from 
        the physical to the digital world in the general public's eye. However, carbon emissions are present and ever-growing. As a reminder, 
        it is predicted the energy from the IT sector will reach 14 percent of global electricity by 2040 (Belkhir & Elmelgi, 2017). 
        Additionally, web designers may not see sustainability as a core responsibility since they are not the ones in charge of developing new 
        renewable energy technologies, the ones passing laws surrounding energy efficiency, or the ones teaching courses about renewable energy. 
        However, web designers still have a role to play in the future of sustainability, as do almost all careers. In fact, up to 40% of the 
        web's carbon footprint can be assigned to the front-end data of a website (Frick, 2016).
      </p>
      
      <p>
        A solution to this barrier is to raise awareness about sustainable web design. As a senior technical writing and UX design student, 
        it was not until this semester that I became aware of what sustainable web design. Web designer managers can organize talks to educate 
        their employees about the basics of sustainable web design as well as the large energy impact the IT sector has. If organizing a team-wide 
        talk takes up too much time or resources, then managers can opt to send out a simple link about sustainability web design in an email 
        or highlight it at the end of a meeting.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Another barrier is that the content web designers create is often at the mercy of their customers. As stated in the previous section, 
        the more features a webpage has the more energy it uses. So in terms of sustainability, less is more. However, companies do not often agree. 
        To them, a simple website may fail to attract customers and stand out from competitors resulting in a loss of revenue. So even if a web designer 
        is aware of sustainable web design, they are paid to listen to the customer and act according to their wishes.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        To combat this solution web designers should tie sustainable design principles with company benefits. For example, instead of pitching fewer 
        images and fonts as a way to save energy, pitch it as how much money is lost when webpages slow down due to excess content. For example, 
        Amazon calculated that a web page slowing down by 1 second could bring them up to $1.6 billion in annual revenue (Frick, 2016). 
        The reality is that the customer is not spending money on a website out of the goodness of their heart, but rather to achieve business goals. 
        If web designers can tie sustainable practices to the customer's business goal, they can kill two birds with one stone.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The final barrier is simply that in terms of data centers, web designers often have little or no say as to what type of energy powers 
        their company's and customer's websites. The solution to this barrier is to start small. Be the one to take the initiative and start 
        the conversation about sustainable web design at your workplace. Educate your coworkers about the main principles of sustainable web design 
        and its benefits, it might be surprising to learn how many other people are interested in learning more. A report found that 63 percent 
        of tech workers want more opportunities to talk about ethical issues and 78% would appreciate more resources to do so (Greenwood, 2021). 
        While things may not change overnight, over a couple of years that first conversation may soon reach those in the company who do have 
        the power to switch company data centers to green hosts.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Advancements in the digital sphere continue to evolve at an exponential rate. As our dependence on the internet continues to grow, 
        so does the urgency to address its carbon footprint. While web designers are not directly responsible for the entire internet's 
        energy consumption, they do play a critical role in shaping the content that goes on the web. By implementing sustainable web design 
        principles into web designers' workflow, we can work together to mitigate the environmental impact of the internet and create a more 
        sustainable future.
